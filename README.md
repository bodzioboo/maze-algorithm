# Maze Algorithm

Implementation of a simple algorithm which creates a graph representation of a two-dimensional maze with specified dimensions (walls and spaces) in a Cartesian coordinate system and then uses two algorithms to find the route between two non-wall points wihtin the maze:
 - Greedy search choosing the route with the minimum L1 distance from the target at any given step.
 - Depth-first search
